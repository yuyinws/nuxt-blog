Sometimes, we want to print styled logs in our app or library, but prefer not to use third-party libraries (care about the bundle size or something).

[Colorful Console](https://colorful-console.vercel.app) is an interactive website that allows you to customize the style of the log and test its output directly in the browser or terminal.
